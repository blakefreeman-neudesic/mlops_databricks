# TO DO : Retrofit This Code So You Can Choose The Environments You Want To Deploy. This Will be
# Helpfull if a Release Pipeline Fails And We Need To Rewind The Commit And Redeploy

# Create A Condition That This Will Not Run When A Pull Request Is Launched. Presumably a CI only Condition
# After The First Environment Deployment, This YAML Pipeline is Triggering Alongside onRealease. I have Set
# pr == none For Now To Prevent This Behaviour
